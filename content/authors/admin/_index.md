I am an ardent technology enthusiast and Project Manager for [MAGID - Safety at work](https://www.magidglove.com/), America’s leading manufacturer, distributor and importer of hand protection and safety products - since 1946.

Outside of work, programming, and web development, I like to travel and spend time with family. I enjoy reading, learning new skills (a committed lifelong learner), being outdoors in the Arizona sun, and staying fit.

This site was spawned from my desire to document, collect, and share pieces of accumulated knowledge. It continues to be a work-in-progress!
